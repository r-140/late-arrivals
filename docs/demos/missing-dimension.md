# Demo: missing-dimension
## Business situation
Order arrives before its customer and customer history.

## Preconditions
Stack healthy (`../START_HERE.md`). Airflow paused. This case has not previously run since reset. Other cases may exist; SQL and verification use unique case IDs. Automatic path: `./bin/lab demo missing-dimension`.

## Step 1 — Seed and build baseline
```bash
./bin/lab seed missing-dimension
./bin/lab inspect missing-dimension
```
Expected: Paid order amount 100 with customer_known=0 and segment=unknown. Revenue is retained.
Source writes are committed PostgreSQL transactions. The script waits for target CDC records before building. Inspect prints Bronze versions and Gold facts separately.

## Step 2 — Introduce the problem
```bash
./bin/lab inject missing-dimension
./bin/lab inspect missing-dimension
```
Expected: Customer and history arrive in Bronze, but Gold remains unresolved until build.
Keep this state visible while inspecting Grafana. Automatic demo mode advances immediately, so use the step-by-step path when watching panels.

## Step 3 — Deliver and reconcile
```bash
./bin/lab build
./bin/lab inspect missing-dimension
./bin/lab verify missing-dimension
```
Expected: Same order and amount 100; customer_known=1, segment=standard.
`verify` asserts the exact fact tuple and fails the command if it differs. `dbt build` also checks unique order keys, positive history intervals and aggregate/fact sum consistency.

## Step 4 — Prove idempotence
```bash
./bin/lab build
./bin/lab verify missing-dimension
```
The fact tuple and revenue must remain identical. Bronze may contain replay copies; Gold must not double count.

## Grafana
Unresolved customers and unknown segment decrease by one. Revenue does not change.
See [panel interpretation](../GRAFANA.md). Panels accumulate across cases; use case-specific inspect output for exact expectations.

## Diagnose unexpected results
Check Connect RUNNING, consumer logs, held-event count and the printed Bronze revision/operation. If Bronze is correct but Gold stale, run build and inspect its error. If Gold changed before your build, pause Airflow. For a clean rerun use `./bin/lab reset` (deletes this lab's data), then repeat step 1.
